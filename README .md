# OASIS INFOBYTE INTERNSHIP

During this internship, I engaged in various data science and analytics tasks, each designed to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field. Here is an overview of the tasks I completed:


```python
# Task 1: IRIS Flower Classification
```

Objective: Predict the species of IRIS Flowers using attributes such as petal length, sepal length, petal width, and sepal width.
Method: Utilized Decision Tree classification (ID3 Classifier) to classify the species.


```python
# Task 2: Unemployment Analysis
```

Objective: Analyze unemployment data through data visualization using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
Approach: Created various charts and graphs to gain insights into unemployment trends.


```python
# Task 3: Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
```

Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various factors like brand reputation, car features, mileage, etc.
Methodology: Explored the area of car price prediction and trained a model for this purpose.


```python
# Task 4: Email Spam Detection
```

Objective: Develop an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
Approach: Utilized Python to build and train a spam detection model to identify and categorize potentially harmful emails.


```python
# Task 5: Sales Prediction
```

Objective: Predict product sales by considering advertising expenditure, target audience, and advertising platforms.
Method: Employed a linear regression model to forecast sales and assist in making informed decisions.

These tasks allowed me to gain practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, contributing to my growth as a data scientist.
